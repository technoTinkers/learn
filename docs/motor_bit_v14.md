## Introduction   

[ELECFREKAS Motor:bit](http://www.elecfreaks.com/estore/elecfreaks-motor-bit-for-micro-bit.html) is a kind of motor drive board based on micro:bit. It has integrated a motor drive chip TB6612, which can drive two DC motors with 1.2A max single channel current. Motor:bit has integrated Octopus series' sensor connectors. You can plug various sensors into it directly. Among these connectors, P0, P3-P7, P9-P10 support sensors with 3.3V power voltage only; P13-P16, P19-P20 support 3.3V or 5V sensors. You can change electric level by sliding the switch on the board.

### Detailed Introduction Of Some Connectors：


**1.VCC Switch-3.3V/5V electric level switch.**

Slide switch to the end of 5V, the electric level of the blue pins (P13、P14、P15、P16、P19、P20) on motor:bit is 5V, and the voltage of the red power pins is 5V too. Similarly, when slide switch to 3.3V, the voltage of blue pins and red pins are 3.3V.

**2.Digital Pin Connector.**

Digital pins: P4、P5、P6、P7、P9、P10.

G-3V3-S connector: 3V3 stands for 3.3V power voltage, G is for GND, S is for signal. GVS is a standard sensor connector, which enables you to plug onto servos and various sensors conveniently. At the same time, it supports our [Octopus Bricks series'products](http://www.elecfreaks.com/estore/octopus-bricks-sensor).

**3.3.3V/5V dual electric level GND-VCC-SIG connector：P13, P14, P15, P16, P19, P20.**

The specialty of G-VCC-SIG connector lies in that it can support 3.3V or 5V power device by shifting electric level of 3.3V/ 5V through VCC connector. At the same time, it supports our [Octopus Bricks series' products](http://www.elecfreaks.com/estore/octopus-bricks-sensor).
