## Introduction    
---  

Micro:bit has integrated multiple sensors including accelerometer. Today, we are going to use accelerometer to make an level device and display the inclination on NeoPixel ring in bar chart format.

## Major Component Introduction    
---  

**Accelerometer**  

There is an accelerometer on your micro:bit which detects the speed change of micro:bit. It converts analog information into digital form that can be used in micro:bit programs. Output is in milli-g. The device will also detect a small number of standard actions, e.g. shake, tilt and free-fall.

The corresponding X, Y, Z axle direction of accelerometer are showed below:

## Programming      
---  

Open Microsoft Makecode, write your code in the edit area. I would like to suggest you program by yourself first.  

Of course, you can download the whole program from the link below.

## Code Explain    
---  

**show bar graph**  
Display the value with bar chart format just similar to plot bar graph.  

**Acceleration**  
Get the acceleration value (milli g-force) in one of three dimensions, or the combined force in all directions (x, y, and z).  


## Experiment Result    
---  

With the inclination of micro:bit, LED bead on Neopixel ring gradually illuminated one by one. The bigger inclination angle, more LED beads will be illuminated.

## Think     
---    

In this case, we have judged the inclination of one direction(X axle) only. If we want to test the inclination of a flat surface( say XY flat surface), then how to design circuit and program. We look forward to your comments and further discussions with us.
