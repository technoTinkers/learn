[Microsoft Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)  


## Programming

### Step 2

- Create a `forever` loop and place an if statement under it. When the variable `flag` equals to 1, then activate the function. 
- Set time delay and play the built-in music `nyan` for once. Then set the variable `flag` to 0.
