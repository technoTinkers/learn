## Introduction
---
Joystick:bit is a game joystick based on Micro:bit. On the board, it has integrated a joystick and 6 undefined keys. It is very convenient for users to extend different communication modules because it has extended connectors like GVS, IIC, SPI, UART. Besides, it has built-in power switch and outer power connector. It is very good to use.
