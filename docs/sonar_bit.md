## Introduction
---

Sonar:bit is an ultrasonic module with 3-5V working voltage. It is available to be used to 3.3V or 5V micro-controller system. With only one 3-wire(GVS) cable, it can work properly. Compared to the normal 4-wire ultrasonic module, it has saved one IO port. The measurement range of sonar:bit is 4cm-400cm. It can output stable and accurate measurement data with Â±1cm tolerance only. You can use this module to occasions like short-distance measurement, smart cars, robots, micro:bit and arduino teaching, etc..

### Hardware Connection  

Connect sonar:bit to P2 port on sensor:bit and connect micro:bit to your computer.  
Once completed, you can see the picture below:

### Programming

Click to open [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) online editor.

Write your program to assign the returned value of P2 to variable distance and display it on micro:bit screen.

Or you can download it from the page below:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:70%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_b7JL2Yd3q3Km" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

### Result

We can see the distance between sonar:bit and the object is displayed on micro:bit in real time. The unit is centimeter.
